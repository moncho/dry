**dry** is a terminal application to manage **Docker** containers and images. It aims to be an alternative to the official **Docker CLI** when it is needed to repeatedly execute commands on existing containers and images, and also as a tool to monitor **Docker** containers from a terminal.

The demo below shows a **dry** session.

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/35825.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/35825?autoplay=1&speed=1.5)

Upon connecting to a **Docker** host (local or remote), the main screen will show the list of containers and version information as reported by the **Docker Engine**. At all times, information about containers, images and networks shown by **dry** is up-to-date.

Most of the commands that can be executed with the official **Docker CLI** on containers, images and networks are available in **dry**, with the exact same behaviour. A list of available commands and their keybinds can be found in **dry** help screen.

Besides this, it:

* Shows real-time information about containers.
* Can sort the container, image and network lists.
* Can navigate and search the output of ***info***, ***inspect*** and ***logs*** commands.  
* Makes easier to cleanup old images and containers.

```
brew tap moncho/dry
brew install dry
```

#### Arch Linux

```
yaourt -S dry

### Usage

Open a console, type ```dry```. It will try to connect to:
* A Docker host given as a parameter (**-H**).
* if none given, a Docker host defined in the **$DOCKER_HOST** environment variable.
* if not defined, to **unix:///var/run/docker.sock**.

If no connection with a Docker host succeeds, **dry** will exit immediately.

```dry -p``` launches dry with [pprof](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/) package active.
